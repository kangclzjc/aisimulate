# Migrate from AIConfigurator

Install AISimulate first, then migrate each CLI workflow when its replacement fits your needs.

The `aisimulate` package includes all six `aiconfigurator cli` commands. You can keep using those
commands while adopting `aisimulate predict` for serving prediction and `aisimulate recommend`
for configuration search. The new commands use YAML inputs and different search semantics.

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental.** The AISimulate recommendation schema and search behavior may change without a
> standard deprecation period. Validate selected configurations on your target hardware.

## 1. Install AISimulate

In the Python environment where you use AIC, replace the standalone distributions:

```bash
python3 -m pip uninstall -y aiconfigurator aiconfigurator-core
python3 -m pip install --upgrade aisimulate
aiconfigurator cli --help
aisimulate --help
```

Both commands now come from AISimulate. Existing AIC flags and experiment YAML continue to use
`aiconfigurator`; there is no automatic converter to the new CLI input format. See the
[Legacy AIC CLI User Guide](legacy-aic-user-guide.md) for the six-command reference.

### 1.1 Migrate Python imports

AISimulate 0.13.0 removes the legacy `aiconfigurator` and
`aiconfigurator_core` Python packages. The `aiconfigurator` executable remains
available. See [Python source migration](../python-source-migration.md) for
replacement imports, the package layout, and downstream qualification requirements.

## 2. AIC to AISimulate command mapping

The rows follow the legacy guide's command order. “Keep AIC” means use the compatibility command
installed above.

| AIC command | Path to use | Key difference |
|---|---|---|
| `generate` | No `aisimulate generate` command planned. | AIC's fast shortcut skips search and SLA optimization. [Deployment-file output](#53-deployment-artifacts) is a separate current gap in the AISimulate CLI. |
| `estimate` | `aisimulate predict` for serving prediction. [Example](#31-migrate-one-concrete-deployment). | Normal summaries include serving metrics and [power and coverage](#411-power-and-energy-analysis). Use `predict --detail summary,memory,time` for optional detail sections. [Example](#410-inspect-prediction-details). `predict --detail energy` adds [energy diagnostics](#411-power-and-energy-analysis) on supported engine paths. [Static estimate modes are intentionally not migrated](#521-static-estimates). See [provider-specific diagnostic limits](#detailed-diagnostics). |
| `support` | Keep AIC `support`. | No unified support-query command. |
| `recommend` | [`aisimulate recommend` with `target: min_gpus`](#minimum-gpu-sizing). | Select the smallest qualifying configuration found under fixed traffic and SLA constraints. Keep AIC for its analytical replica-sizing result. |
| `default` | `aisimulate recommend`. [Example](#32-search-with-a-fixed-gpu-budget). | Supply traffic, a GPU ceiling, and a search objective. |
| `exp` | Keep AIC for existing experiment files. | Translate individual experiments to `predict` or `recommend`; no equivalent file orchestration. |

## 3. General migration examples

These examples use the offline `engine` stack and pin vLLM performance-data version 0.24.0.
The output excerpts were captured with AISimulate 0.12.0 built from this repository on
2026-09-14. They are simulation results and may change with the software or performance data.
Save the YAML files as named and run commands from that directory, using fresh output directories.
For Dynamo Router/Planner integration, see
[execution stacks](user-guide.md#choose-an-execution-stack).

### 3.1 Migrate one concrete deployment

**Before — AIC estimates a batch at a fixed parallel configuration:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --estimate-mode agg --tp-size 2 --batch-size 64 \
  --isl 1024 --osl 128
```

**After — predict serving behavior on two H200 GPUs.** Save as `prediction.yaml`:

```yaml
traffic:
  source: {type: synthetic, input_tokens: 1024, output_tokens: 128}
  load: {type: concurrency, concurrency: 64}
  stop: {requests: 100}
engine:
  mode: aggregated
  model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B
  hardware: h200_sxm
  backend: vllm
  backend_version: "0.24.0"
  workers:
    aggregated:
      parallelism: {tensor: 2, replicas: 1}
```

```bash
aisimulate predict --config prediction.yaml --output-dir ./prediction-output
```

**Result to inspect:** `prediction-output/prediction.json` contains completed-request counts, TTFT,
inter-token latency, and output throughput. Recorded report excerpt (rounded):

```json
{
  "completed_requests": 100,
  "mean_ttft_ms": 365.35,
  "mean_itl_ms": 8.54,
  "output_throughput_tok_s": 5114.43
}
```

**What changed:** AIC's `--batch-size 64` fixes an estimator batch. AISimulate's `concurrency: 64`
keeps up to 64 requests in flight while the scheduler forms batches. Here TP=2 and one replica
use two GPUs, but the latency and throughput results describe serving traffic. Use AIC when you
need its original batch-level result.

<a id="search-with-a-fixed-gpu-budget"></a>

### 3.2 Search with a fixed GPU budget

**Before — AIC searches within an eight-GPU budget:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli default \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 --serving-mode agg \
  --total-gpus 8 --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --ttft 800 --tpot 30 --strict-sla
```

**After — search for throughput with 32 requests in flight.** Save as `budget-search.yaml`:

```yaml
traffic:
  source: {type: synthetic, input_tokens: 1024, output_tokens: 128}
  load: {type: concurrency, concurrency: 32}
  stop: {requests: 320}
engine:
  mode: aggregated
  model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B
  hardware: h200_sxm
  backend: vllm
  backend_version: "0.24.0"
  workers:
    aggregated:
      parallelism: {preset: default}
evaluation:
  sla: {ttft_ms: 800, itl_ms: 30}
optimization:
  target: throughput
  strict_sla: true
  constraints: {max_candidate_gpus: 8}
optimizer: {algorithm: random, max_trials: 8, parallelism: 1, seed: 11}
```

```bash
aisimulate recommend --config budget-search.yaml --output-dir ./budget-search
```

**Result to inspect:** the terminal lists selected configurations. Recorded output excerpt (first two results):

```text
AISimulate recommendations
1: score=8518 used_gpus=8 config=budget-search/recommendations/0001.yaml
2: score=6753 used_gpus=6 config=budget-search/recommendations/0002.yaml
```

The score for `target: throughput` is output tokens/s; `used_gpus` is the candidate's GPU count.
`budget-search/recommendation.json` records candidate metrics and rejection reasons. Selected
prediction inputs are saved under `budget-search/recommendations/`, in rank order. Evaluate the
first result with:

```bash
aisimulate predict \
  --config ./budget-search/recommendations/0001.yaml \
  --output-dir ./budget-selected
```

Check `budget-selected/prediction.json` for latency and throughput under the saved workload.
If the completed search selects no configuration and has zero resource-limited candidates, it writes
`recommendation.json`, exits with status 1, and produces no selected YAML. Resource-limited
candidates instead produce exit 3, including when fitting candidates and selected YAML remain
available. Inspect the ledger and [resource diagnostics](../local-resources.md) before predicting
a selected configuration or treating the search as complete.

**What changed:** eight GPUs is a ceiling, so the winner may use fewer. This example evaluates
eight random trials to keep the walkthrough bounded; increase the trial budget for your search.
It ranks configurations under the supplied traffic and does not reproduce AIC's full capacity
sweep. With `strict_sla: true`, candidates must pass the configured aggregate-mean latency bounds.

<a id="search-under-a-request-rate"></a>

### 3.3 Search under a request rate

**Before — AIC sizes the minimum GPUs for four requests/s:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli recommend \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --target-request-rate 4 --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --ttft 800 --tpot 30 --strict-sla
```

In the recorded AIC run, the top aggregated sizing result used **one GPU**: TP=1 and one replica.

**After — if your goal is to rank configurations at that load,** reuse `budget-search.yaml` and
override its traffic and objective:

```bash
aisimulate recommend --config budget-search.yaml \
  --set 'traffic.load={type: constant_rate, requests_per_second: 4}' \
  --set optimization.target=goodput_per_gpu \
  --output-dir ./rate-search
```

**Result to inspect:** `rate-search/recommendation.json` and its selected prediction YAML.
Recorded terminal excerpt (first two results):

```text
AISimulate recommendations
1: score=255.4 used_gpus=2 config=rate-search/recommendations/0001.yaml
2: score=254.7 used_gpus=2 config=rate-search/recommendations/0002.yaml
```

The top result here uses **two GPUs**. Its score is SLA-qualified output tokens/s/GPU.
The input/output lengths, eight-GPU ceiling, latency bounds, and trial budget come from
`budget-search.yaml`. To search at a fixed concurrency
instead, use `--set 'traffic.load={type: concurrency, concurrency: 32}'`.

**What changed:** offered request rate and in-flight concurrency describe traffic; they do not
ask AISimulate for the smallest fleet that can serve it. Ranking by `goodput_per_gpu` can select
more GPUs than the smallest SLA-compliant configuration. Use [minimum-GPU selection](#minimum-gpu-sizing)
when GPU count is the objective, or keep AIC for its analytical replica-sizing result.

<a id="predict-regular-prefilldecode-disaggregation"></a>

### 4.1 Predict regular prefill/decode disaggregation

**Before — AIC estimates separate prefill and decode workers:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --estimate-mode disagg --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --prefill-tp-size 1 --prefill-batch-size 1 --prefill-num-workers 1 \
  --decode-tp-size 1 --decode-batch-size 64 --decode-num-workers 1
```

**After — predict serving traffic with one H200 GPU per role.** Reuse the earlier `prediction.yaml`,
set `engine.mode: disaggregated`, and replace its aggregated worker with prefill and decode workers:

```bash
aisimulate predict --config prediction.yaml \
  --set engine.mode=disaggregated \
  --set 'engine.workers={prefill: {parallelism: {tensor: 1, replicas: 1}}, decode: {parallelism: {tensor: 1, replicas: 1}}}' \
  --output-dir ./pd-prediction
```

**Result to inspect:** `pd-prediction/prediction.json` contains the serving latency and throughput
for the two-GPU deployment.

**What changed:** AIC fixes the prefill and decode batch sizes. AISimulate reuses the earlier
64-request concurrency and lets each role's scheduler form batches. Both roles share the configured
model, hardware, backend, and backend version; their parallelism, scheduler, and KV-cache settings
can differ. `engine.kv_transfer` controls transfer bandwidth and which prompt KV bytes are charged.
For search, use the same two roles with recommendation domains; see the
[engine fields](user-guide.md#engine-fields). To override hardware per role, use the
[heterogeneous P/D YAML example](#48-migrate-heterogeneous-pd-hardware) below.

<a id="search-parallelism-and-throughput-tradeoffs"></a>

### 4.2 Search parallelism and throughput tradeoffs

**Before — AIC searches parallel configurations within an eight-GPU budget:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli default \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --serving-mode agg --total-gpus 8 --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --ttft 800 --tpot 30 --strict-sla
```

**After — search explicit TP choices and return throughput tradeoffs.** Reuse `budget-search.yaml`:

```bash
aisimulate recommend --config budget-search.yaml \
  --set engine.workers.aggregated.parallelism.preset=false \
  --set 'engine.workers.aggregated.parallelism.tensor={choices: [1, 2, 4]}' \
  --set optimization.target=pareto \
  --output-dir ./pareto-search
```

**Result to inspect:** `pareto-search/recommendation.json` records the nondominated
`throughput_per_gpu` versus `throughput_per_user` frontier and its selected prediction YAML.

**What changed:** the AIC command uses its capacity sweep and default parallelism domain. The
AISimulate command uses the earlier 32-request concurrency, restricts TP to 1/2/4, and returns a
Pareto front instead of a scalar ranking. AISimulate also exposes attention DP, MoE TP/EP, replicas,
and supported backend choices; P/D workers can also override the fallback hardware SKU. See
[parallelism presets](user-guide.md#parallelism-preset-behavior) and
[optimization goals](user-guide.md#optimization-goal).

<a id="replay-traces-and-multi-turn-sessions"></a>

### 4.3 Replay traces and multi-turn sessions

**AIC counterpart:** the AIC CLI has no corresponding trace/session replay command. This is an
additional AISimulate serving-simulation capability.

**AISimulate example — inspect individual requests in a prediction:**

```bash
aisimulate predict --config prediction.yaml --capture-per-request --output-dir ./request-details
```

**Result to inspect:** `request-details/requests.jsonl` contains individual request records alongside
the aggregate `prediction.json`.

**What changes for an AIC user:** the command above keeps the earlier synthetic workload. Replace
its traffic using the [trace example and format table](user-guide.md#trace-source), or the
[synthetic-session example](user-guide.md#synthetic-session-source), to replay recorded requests or
multi-turn sessions. Trace inputs include Mooncake, Dynamo, and agentic formats; format-specific
topology restrictions apply. Sessions preserve turn order and can model shared-prefix groups.
Their shared-prefix ratio is a workload model, not a direct translation of AIC's exact `--prefix`
token count. Analytical EPD does not support traces, sessions, or per-request capture; AFD requires
fixed synthetic requests.

<a id="model-cache-capacity-and-host-offload"></a>

### 4.4 Model cache capacity and host offload

**Before — AIC estimates a fixed cached prefix and GPU-memory allocation:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --estimate-mode agg --tp-size 2 --batch-size 64 --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --prefix 512 --free-gpu-memory-fraction 0.8
```

**After — configure serving-cache capacity and add host offload.** Reuse `prediction.yaml`:

```bash
aisimulate predict --config prediction.yaml \
  --set engine.workers.aggregated.kv_cache.capacity.memory_fraction=0.8 \
  --set 'engine.workers.aggregated.kv_cache.host_offload={num_host_blocks: 4096}' \
  --output-dir ./cache-prediction
```

**Result to inspect:** `cache-prediction/prediction.json` reports the serving result with the
configured GPU/host KV capacity. Whether offload is exercised depends on cache pressure and reuse.

**What changed:** AIC's `--prefix 512` assumes 512 tokens are already cached. AISimulate models prefix
reuse from the workload and cache state; the command above does not recreate that fixed hit count.
The fixed-count option is [intentionally not migrated](#fixed-cached-prefix-counts).
Host offload is an additional serving feature with no matching AIC CLI flag. This vLLM example uses
prefix caching and attention DP=1, as required by the
[host-offload contract](user-guide.md#native-vllm-host-offload-prediction). Host capacity and bandwidth
stay fixed during recommendation. Recommendation requires concrete aggregated vLLM, a disabled
parallelism preset (`preset: false`), and fixed `attention_data: 1`; other supported fields, such as
`tensor` and `replicas`, may still be searched. Other `kv_cache` controls include block size, fixed
GPU capacity, and CUDA-graph memory reservation.

<a id="fixed-cached-prefix-counts"></a>

#### 4.4.1 Fixed cached-prefix counts: intentionally not migrated

AIC's `--prefix N` assumes the first `N` input tokens are already cached for every request.
AISimulate intentionally does not expose an equivalent fixed-count option in `predict` or
`recommend`. For serving prediction and configuration search, prefer prefix reuse derived from
the workload and the simulated cache state.

Replay drives request arrivals and worker placement. Each simulated worker's engine (Mocker)
maintains its KV cache dynamically: it makes computed blocks available for reuse, matches later
requests against available prefixes, and evicts eligible blocks when capacity is needed. A request
that encounters a cold cache must compute its prefix; a later request sharing that prefix can
reuse it if the matching blocks are still available on the worker that serves it. Cache hits
therefore depend on request history, worker placement, cache capacity, and backend block rules.
Assuming a fixed hit count for every request would bypass these effects and could overstate
prefill savings.

To model reuse, enable `engine.workers.<role>.kv_cache.prefix_caching` on a supported backend and
supply shared prefixes through a [trace](user-guide.md#trace-source) or
[synthetic sessions](user-guide.md#synthetic-session-source). For independent synthetic requests,
set `traffic.source.cached_prefix_tokens` to share an exact number of input tokens, as shown in
[section 4.6.3](#preserve-pinned-engine-and-request-controls). This also preserves a cold first
request. Enabling caching alone does not create shared input. Session `shared_prefix_ratio` and
`prefix_groups` describe workload sharing; they do not guarantee a cache-hit count or ratio. This KV prefix reuse is separate from ngram
prompt-lookup speculative decoding.

Keep the bundled AIC compatibility CLI for controlled cached-prefix what-if estimates or
comparisons that require the same fixed-token assumption. The [AIC example in section 5.5](#exact-cached-prefix-estimates)
shows that workflow. Its fixed-count option is a deliberate compatibility boundary, not pending
unified-CLI migration work.

<a id="include-dynamo-routing-and-planning"></a>

### 4.5 Include Dynamo routing and planning

**AIC counterpart:** the AIC CLI can size configurations and generate deployment files; it has no
corresponding Router/Planner replay command.

**AISimulate example — run with the Dynamo adapter.** Install `ai-dynamo` and save the
[complete Dynamo prediction example](user-guide.md#complete-dynamo-prediction-example) as
`dynamo-prediction.yaml`, then run:

```bash
aisimulate predict --stack dynamo --config dynamo-prediction.yaml --output-dir ./dynamo-prediction
```

**Result to inspect:** `dynamo-prediction/prediction.json` contains the serving metrics for the
configured engine and Router. That linked example uses round-robin routing with Planner disabled.

**What changes for an AIC user:** `--stack dynamo` accepts Router policy and Planner scaling
configuration in addition to the core serving inputs. For a search that includes Planner settings,
use the [Dynamo search example](user-guide.md#dynamo-scalar-recommendation-example). Planner runtime
scaling limits and the search's candidate GPU budget are separate controls.

<a id="select-op-level-or-whole-forward-fpm-timing"></a>

<a id="46-select-op-level-or-whole-forward-fpm-timing"></a>

### 4.6 Select and configure performance estimators

#### 4.6.1 Select an estimator

**Before — AIC estimates a batch using collected whole-forward profiles:**

```bash
AIC_ALLOW_UNLISTED_VERSIONS=1 aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7 \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.25.1 \
  --forward-model fpm --estimate-mode agg \
  --tp-size 4 --moe-tp-size 4 --moe-ep-size 1 \
  --fmha-quant-mode bfloat16 --batch-size 4 --isl 1024 --osl 32
```

**After — use FPM timing in a serving prediction for the same model, hardware, and parallelism:**

```bash
AIC_ALLOW_UNLISTED_VERSIONS=1 aisimulate predict \
  --config tests/e2e/configs/unified_cli/predict/fpm/01-minimax-m27-h200-tp4-fpm.yaml \
  --set engine.workers.aggregated.timing.estimation_mode=fpm_interpolation \
  --set engine.workers.aggregated.timing.fallback_policy=deny \
  --output-dir ./minimax-fpm
```

**Result to inspect:** `minimax-fpm/prediction.json` contains the serving prediction using
whole-forward profiles.

**What changed:** AIC's `--forward-model fpm` maps to the per-role
`engine.workers.<role>.timing.estimation_mode: fpm_interpolation` setting. The defaults are
`estimation_mode: auto` and `fallback_policy: deny`. Auto searches
`op_level -> fpm_interpolation -> fpm_regression` during construction, including with deny.
For an explicit mode, deny prevents switching estimators; allow tries that mode first, then the
remaining estimators in the same global priority order. Invalid configuration does not trigger
fallback. An untrained regression is not ready for offline simulation, and queries do not
silently switch estimators after construction. Saved `timing.forward_model` inputs are migrated
with their explicit mode and strict selection preserved; use `estimation_mode` in new configs.

The AISimulate fixture uses four in-flight requests rather than fixing every scheduler batch to
four. The AIC command pins FMHA precision to match the collected profile. Both commands pin
vLLM 0.25.1, which requires the shown unlisted-version override. FPM requires
`timing.type: default` and matching profile coverage; the explicit FPM/deny example fails when
that profile is missing. See the [FPM guide](../../python/aisimulate/docs/fpm/README.md).

#### 4.6.2 Configure data policies and estimator tuning

**Choose performance-data and transfer policies.** This uses `HYBRID`, conservative transfer, and
the bundled system definitions:

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --estimate-mode agg --batch-size 64 --tp-size 2 \
  --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --database-mode HYBRID --transfer-policy conservative --systems-paths default \
  --detail source
```

**Result to inspect:** the estimate and per-operation source breakdown show which data supplied
the prediction. A policy choice does not guarantee coverage. `SOL` selects theoretical estimates;
custom system directories can be added to `--systems-paths`. See
[database modes](legacy-aic-user-guide.md#database-mode) and
[system paths](legacy-aic-user-guide.md#systems-paths).

**After — carry the policy into serving prediction and recommendation:**

```bash
aisimulate predict --config prediction.yaml \
  --set engine.database_mode=HYBRID \
  --set engine.transfer_policy=conservative \
  --set 'engine.systems_paths=[default]' \
  --set engine.estimation_mode=auto --set engine.fallback_policy=deny \
  --output-dir ./policy-prediction

aisimulate recommend --config budget-search.yaml \
  --set engine.database_mode=HYBRID \
  --set engine.transfer_policy=conservative \
  --set 'engine.systems_paths=[default]' \
  --output-dir ./policy-search
```

Use an ordered list of existing directories plus `default` to search custom data before the
bundled root. These controls require regular aggregated/disaggregated language workers with
default timing in every role. AFD, analytical encoder pools, and fixed/polynomial providers keep
their existing paths. Recommendation YAML pins each selected role's effective data root, version,
policy, estimator mode, and full estimator configuration for a subsequent prediction.

`engine.estimator_config` carries supported regression/correction controls; see the
[canonical API](../core-api.md#estimator-controls). Shared role-based correction is deferred:
current native correction stores and the latest role-bound regression routing remain unchanged.
The unified CLI does not expose AIC's per-operation source breakdown shown above; keep the
compatibility CLI or SDK for that diagnostic.

<a id="preserve-pinned-engine-and-request-controls"></a>

#### 4.6.3 Preserve pinned engine and request controls

The unified `predict` and `recommend` configurations accept the following flat
`engine` controls. They use the same canonical estimator interface as estimator
selection and fallback policy.

| AIC control | Unified configuration |
| --- | --- |
| `nextn`, `nextn_accepted` | `engine.nextn`, `engine.nextn_accepted` (both required for MTP) |
| Chunked prefill | `engine.enable_chunked_prefill` (omit for backend default) |
| EPLB and redundant expert slots | `engine.enable_eplb`, `engine.wideep_num_slots` |
| MoE and attention kernel backends | `engine.moe_backend`, `engine.attention_backend` |
| Quantization overrides | `engine.gemm_quant_mode`, `engine.moe_quant_mode`, `engine.kvcache_quant_mode`, `engine.fmha_quant_mode`, `engine.comm_quant_mode`; `--kvcache-quant-mode bfloat16 --fmha-quant-mode bfloat16` also maps to the per-role `engine.workers.<role>.kv_cache.dtype: bfloat16` |
| Exact synthetic shared prefix | `traffic.source.cached_prefix_tokens` |
| Maximum sequence length | Existing `engine.context_length` |
| GPU memory fraction | Existing `engine.workers.<role>.kv_cache.capacity.memory_fraction` |

`enable_wideep` is obsolete: topology now determines the MoE execution regime.
The new model controls require default timing on every language role. AFD and
analytical encoder configurations reject them. Backend/model compatibility is
validated by the canonical constructor before simulation. Use `--stack engine`
for these controls and exact synthetic shared prefixes. Older Dynamo adapters
do not support them and fail capability validation before replay. Explicit MTP
expected acceptance also requires an opt-in runner capability; legacy acceptance-rate
payloads retain their existing compatibility. AFD and
AFD+PD reject positive `cached_prefix_tokens`.

This recommendation example preserves a token-exact shared prefix and explicit
KV quantization while using the existing capacity field:

    output_tokens: 128
    cached_prefix_tokens: 256
  load:
    type: concurrency
    concurrency: 8
  stop:
    requests: 32
optimization:
  constraints:
    max_candidate_gpus: 8
```

For MTP-capable models, specify both `engine.nextn: 2` and
`engine.nextn_accepted: 1.25`. The accepted count is a workload assumption:
replay uses one guaranteed accepted draft token and a 25% chance of a second.
Saved candidate YAML retains these values and all engine model controls.
A shared prefix does not mean a prewarmed cache; the first request remains cold.
Only complete cache blocks can be reused, so a shared prefix shorter than the
engine cache block size can produce zero hits.

### 4.7 Predict and search analytical EPD

**Before — AIC estimates a dedicated image-encoder pool plus an aggregated language worker:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct \
  --system h200_sxm --backend sglang --backend-version 0.5.14 \
  --estimate-mode agg --tp-size 1 --batch-size 8 --isl 128 --osl 32 \
  --image-height 448 --image-width 448 --num-images 1 \
  --enable-epd --encoder-tp 1 --encoder-batch-size 2 --encoder-num-workers 1
```

**After — predict the same E+agg layout or search encoder and language-worker configurations:**

```bash
aisimulate predict --config examples/cli/epd-predict-aggregated.yaml --output-dir ./epd-prediction
aisimulate recommend --config examples/cli/epd-recommend.yaml --output-dir ./epd-search
```

**Result to inspect:** `epd-prediction/prediction.json` identifies the `analytical_epd_overlay`;
`epd-search/recommendations/` contains selected encoder/language-worker prediction configurations.

**What changed:** encoder flags move to `engine.workers.encoder`, and image inputs move to
`traffic.source.images`. The prediction uses eight in-flight requests; the search example also
explores E+P+D. These paths require fixed synthetic images and concurrency. They model encoder
capacity and latency without event-level encoder queueing or embedding transfer. See
[EPD inputs and limits](../sweeper/epd.md#unified-cli).

### 4.8 Migrate heterogeneous P/D hardware

**Before — AIC searches H200 prefill with GB200 decode:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli default \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --decode-system gb200 --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --serving-mode disagg --total-gpus 2 --isl 128 --osl 8 \
  --ttft 800 --tpot 30 --strict-sla
```

AIC disaggregated experiment YAML uses `prefill_system_name` and `decode_system_name`.
Translate them to `engine.workers.prefill.hardware` and `engine.workers.decode.hardware`.
Each omitted role inherits the required `engine.hardware` fallback. These are concrete
hardware identifiers, not search domains.

**After — save this as `heterogeneous-pd.yaml`.** It uses H200 prefill and GB200 decode, real op-level
timing, and inferred KV capacity on each GPU type:

```yaml
traffic:
  source: {type: synthetic, input_tokens: 128, output_tokens: 8}
  load: {type: concurrency, concurrency: 2}
  stop: {requests: 6}
engine:
  mode: disaggregated
  model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B
  hardware: h200_sxm
  backend: vllm
  backend_version: 0.24.0
  context_length: 4096
  kv_transfer: {bytes_per_token: auto, bandwidth_gb_per_second: 50}
  workers:
    prefill:
      parallelism: {preset: [{replicas: 1, tensor: 1, pipeline: 1, attention_data: 1, moe_tensor: 1, moe_expert: 1}]}
      scheduler: {max_batched_tokens: 8192, max_sequences: 1}
    decode:
      hardware: gb200
      parallelism: {preset: [{replicas: 1, tensor: 1, pipeline: 1, attention_data: 1, moe_tensor: 1, moe_expert: 1}]}
      scheduler: {max_batched_tokens: 8192, max_sequences: 8}
evaluation:
  sla: {ttft_ms: 800, itl_ms: 30}
optimization:
  target: throughput
  strict_sla: true
  constraints: {max_candidate_gpus: 2}
optimizer: {algorithm: random, max_trials: 1, parallelism: 1, seed: 14}
```

```bash
aisimulate recommend --config heterogeneous-pd.yaml --output-dir /tmp/heterogeneous-pd
aisimulate predict --config /tmp/heterogeneous-pd/recommendations/0001.yaml \
  --output-dir /tmp/heterogeneous-pd-predict
```

**Result to inspect:** the saved recommendation retains `engine.hardware: h200_sxm` and the decode override
`hardware: gb200`. Prediction reuses those identities and reports `completed_requests: 6`.
This bounded example pins one GPU per role and evaluates one candidate; remove the fixed
`parallelism` entries and increase `max_candidate_gpus` and `max_trials` to search parallel layouts. Each role is independently checked for parallelism
and KV capacity on its effective hardware, within the shared GPU budget. In a search over
both aggregated and disaggregated modes, only P/D candidates use the role overrides;
aggregated candidates use the fallback.

**What changed:** this example fixes concurrency at two requests instead of reproducing
AIC's capacity sweep. P/D still shares one model, backend, and backend version. When a role hardware override
is present and `backend_version` is omitted, both effective SKUs must resolve to the same
latest version; otherwise set a common supported version explicitly, as above. Hardware
overrides are rejected on aggregated workers and AFD companions. The separate analytical
EPD encoder hardware setting is unchanged.

The Sweeper SDK also retains `search_space.prefill_hardware_sku` and
`search_space.decode_hardware_sku`. Heterogeneous deployment-manifest generation remains
unsupported. With the Dynamo stack, Router AIC hooks must use the effective prefill SKU.
Search and prediction reject a hook using the fallback when it differs from the prefill
override, including when both P/D overrides match each other. Use a Router provider that
consumes the role hardware, or a non-AIC prefill load model.

<a id="afd-translation"></a>

### 4.9 AFD translation

**Before — AIC runs a bounded search for decode-side AFD with a regular prefill companion:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli default \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-32B --system h200_sxm --backend trtllm \
  --serving-mode afd --total-gpus 32 --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --afd-max-a-batch-size 128 --afd-max-candidates 32 --afd-candidate-overflow truncate \
  --ttft 800 --tpot 30 --strict-sla
```

**After — search the same topology intent with the analytical AFD engine.** Save as
`afd-recommendation.yaml`:

<!-- afd-migration-contract-start -->
```yaml
traffic:
  source:
    type: synthetic
    input_tokens: 1024
    output_tokens: 128
  load:
    type: constant_rate
    requests_per_second: 4
  stop:
    requests_per_load_unit: 10

engine:
  mode: afd
  model: Qwen/Qwen3-32B
  hardware: h200_sxm
  backend: trtllm
  afd:
    phase: decode
    combined_with_pd: true
    a_batch_size: 128

evaluation:
  sla:
    ttft_ms: 800
    itl_ms: 30

optimization:
  target: throughput_per_gpu
  strict_sla: true
  constraints:
    max_candidate_gpus: 32
```
<!-- afd-migration-contract-end -->

```bash
aisimulate recommend --config afd-recommendation.yaml --output-dir ./afd-search
aisimulate predict --config ./afd-search/recommendations/0001.yaml --output-dir ./afd-selected
```

**Result to inspect:** `afd-search/recommendations/0001.yaml` describes a concrete topology;
`afd-selected/afd-replay-spec.json` and `afd-selected/afd-qualification.json` record the analytical
inputs and GPU accounting.

**What changed:** `engine.afd` makes the decode-side AFD and prefill-companion topology explicit.
The GPU budget includes attention, FFN, and companion pools. The search uses an explicit request
rate and throughput/GPU objective. The AIC example caps attention batch size at 128 and explicitly
truncates enumeration to 32 topologies; the AISimulate YAML fixes attention batch size at 128.
These searches do not cover identical operating points. Native
AFD deployment generation remains unavailable. Use fixed-length synthetic traffic with an
absolute load; see [AFD topology and limits](../sweeper/afd-topology.md).

### 4.10 Inspect prediction details

Use `aisimulate predict --detail` to inspect serving metrics and the memory capacity estimate.

**Before — select diagnostic reports in AIC:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --batch-size 64 --tp-size 2 \
  --isl 1024 --osl 128 --detail summary,memory,time
```

`--detail` belongs to `aiconfigurator cli estimate`; `aiconfigurator cli default` does not accept
it. With no `--detail`, `estimate` prints its normal summary without extra detail sections.
The example uses the default aggregated estimate mode and prints its summary, memory components,
and available phase/per-operation timing.

**After — inspect supported serving details** using `prediction.yaml` from
[the concrete-deployment example](#31-migrate-one-concrete-deployment):

```bash
aisimulate predict --config prediction.yaml --detail summary,memory,time \
  --output-dir ./prediction-details
```

| AISimulate selector | Supported evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `summary` | Existing serving prediction metrics. |
| `memory` | Initial per-rank capacity estimate and available memory components, with `stage: before_native_capacity_adjustments`. |
| `time` | Serving latency statistics plus native accumulated phase/operation latency, SOL comparisons, and latency/SOL ratios. |
| `source` | Per-operation source tags and executed MoE communication measurement substitutions. |
| `all` | All five selectors, including [energy diagnostics in section 4.11](#411-power-and-energy-analysis). |

**Captured result for the `prediction.yaml` above** (AISimulate 0.12.0 with this detail
implementation, 2026-09-15; simulation results, latency/throughput rounded):

| Section | Field | Value |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `summary` | Completed requests | 100 |
| `summary` | Output throughput (tokens/s) | 5114.43 |
| `time` | Mean TTFT (ms) | 365.35 |
| `time` | Mean inter-token latency (ms) | 8.54 |
| `time` | Mean request latency (ms) | 1449.85 |
| `memory` | Weights per rank (bytes) | 8,029,995,008 |
| `memory` | KV capacity estimate per rank (bytes) | 123,674,925,465 |
| `memory` | Estimated GPU blocks per rank | 29,486 |

Memory has `stage: before_native_capacity_adjustments`. Both ranks use the same estimate;
the table does not sum capacity across TP=2. The command selects summary, memory, and time;
an energy breakdown is requested separately as shown in [section 4.11](#411-power-and-energy-analysis).
For terminal and JSON examples, including a skipped memory section, see
[Captured detail output](user-guide.md#captured-detail-output).

The terminal identifies skipped sections with reasons. `prediction.json` stores the selected
`details.sections` and `details.skipped`; `--format json` prints the same `details` object beside
`summary`. Memory may be skipped for explicit KV blocks or providers/topologies without an
exported estimate. Its block count is an initial estimate, not a final runtime allocation.
Analytical EPD retains available language-worker estimates and identifies the missing encoder
component breakdown; it does not claim a complete EPD memory report.
`time` and `source` operation evidence requires the native op-level engine path. SOL gaps carry
null values and explicit reasons; source records preserve executed measurement substitutions.
`--detail-top-n` bounds tables only; JSON keeps complete evidence. See
[section 4.11](#411-power-and-energy-analysis) for energy availability.
For recommendation details, run `predict --detail` on a saved recommendation YAML.
See the [detail output contract](user-guide.md#prediction-details).

**What changed:** AISimulate reports the configured serving workload, rather than reproducing
AIC's fixed-batch estimate. Its `time` section separates request statistics from accumulated
scheduled forward-pass work per GPU; operation sums are not wall-clock or request latency.
[Provider availability limits](#detailed-diagnostics) remain explicit.

<a id="54-power-and-energy-analysis"></a>

### 4.11 Power and energy analysis

**Migration status: implemented by the power stack.** Normal engine prediction and
recommendation summaries always show both power fields; `--detail energy` adds a breakdown.
Section 4.10 retains the captured output from the initial three-section detail implementation.
`--detail all` includes both `energy` and the operation provenance in `source`.
The native engine runner exports phase and operation evidence with op-level timing on supported
topologies. The external Dynamo Python adapter's diagnostics export is not qualified by this
stack; missing exports receive an explicit unavailable reason.

Numeric watts require qualifying operation-energy data. The B200/TRT-LLM example below
requires the [power dataset from #212](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aisimulate/pull/212)
alongside the summary implementation from #142.

#### 4.11.1 Summary power without energy details

**Before — AIC includes power in its normal estimate summary:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system b200_sxm --backend trtllm --backend-version 1.3.0rc20 \
  --batch-size 64 --tp-size 2 --isl 1024 --osl 128
```

**Recorded result:** `Power (per GPU): 660.4 W`, without a detail flag. Omitting
`--estimate-mode` uses AIC's default `agg` estimator, corresponding to the aggregated
serving configuration below. The bundled AIC reporting fix in #144 preserves energy
evidence through this default path and supports the breakdown in 4.11.2.

**After — AISimulate summary with modeled power from operation-energy evidence.** Save as
`power-prediction.yaml`. This uses the same traffic shape as section 3.1, with the
B200/TRT-LLM dataset supplied by #212:

```yaml
traffic:
  source: {type: synthetic, input_tokens: 1024, output_tokens: 128}
  load: {type: concurrency, concurrency: 64}
  stop: {requests: 100}
engine:
  mode: aggregated
  model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B
  hardware: b200_sxm
  backend: trtllm
  backend_version: "1.3.0rc20"
  workers:
    aggregated:
      parallelism: {tensor: 2, replicas: 1}
```

```bash
aisimulate predict --stack engine --config power-prediction.yaml --output-dir ./power-summary
```

**Recorded result:** the verified CLI/data integration described in
[4.11.3](#4113-captured-result) produced this excerpt from `power-summary/prediction.json`
(values rounded):

```json
{
  "completed_requests": 100,
  "power_w": 655.9411,
  "power_coverage": 0.90703175
}
```

The terminal displays **655.94 W per GPU** and **90.70% power-data coverage**, without
`--detail`. This is modeled active forward-pass power derived from operation profiles;
90.70% describes latency covered by energy evidence, not prediction accuracy. The result
requires #212's data and can change with the workload or profile revision.

**Unavailable-data example.** Reuse the H200/vLLM `prediction.yaml` from
[section 3.1](#31-migrate-one-concrete-deployment):

```bash
aisimulate predict --stack engine --config prediction.yaml --output-dir ./power-unavailable
```

A recorded run of this H200/vLLM configuration completed 100 requests and returned:

```json
{"power_w": null, "power_coverage": 0.0}
```

The terminal keeps both labels visible and explains that watts are unavailable because
energy coverage is insufficient. This distinguishes missing data from a zero-watt estimate.

For recommendation summaries, reuse `budget-search.yaml` from
[section 3.2](#32-search-with-a-fixed-gpu-budget):

```bash
aisimulate recommend --stack engine --config budget-search.yaml --output-dir ./power-search
```

Each displayed recommendation row includes `power_w` and `power_coverage`. Numeric watts
still require qualifying data; the H200/vLLM configuration above does not gain coverage by
running a search. No `--detail` selector is required to calculate or display either summary
value. JSON includes both keys in prediction summaries and recommendation metrics for valid
replay reports, using `null` for unavailable values under the publication gate below.

[Example: captured summary and energy output](#4113-captured-result).

#### 4.11.2 Summary power with an energy breakdown

**Before — add energy detail to the same AIC estimate:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system b200_sxm --backend trtllm --backend-version 1.3.0rc20 \
  --batch-size 64 --tp-size 2 --isl 1024 --osl 128 --detail energy
```

**Recorded result:** the normal summary still prints **660.4 W/GPU**, followed by positive
mixed-step and decode-only energy totals and per-operation contributions. See the
[captured output](#4113-captured-result).

**After — AISimulate energy detail**, using the same `power-prediction.yaml`:

```bash
aisimulate predict --stack engine --config power-prediction.yaml --detail energy \
  --output-dir ./power-details
```

**Result to inspect:** the same summary power and coverage as the
normal prediction, plus phase and per-operation energy evidence when available. The selector
controls only the additional breakdown; it must not enable summary power or relax its coverage
gate. Missing breakdown evidence must be identified as unavailable with a reason. For a selected
recommendation, use its saved prediction YAML with `predict --detail energy`; this does not add
a `--detail` flag to `recommend`.

[Example: captured summary and energy output](#4113-captured-result).

**Availability in both workflows.** The [modeled-power contract](../power-model.md) defines
`power_w` as active forward-pass average watts per GPU and `power_coverage` as latency-weighted
energy-data coverage. Human-readable summaries keep both labels visible in every availability
state. The following values are synthetic examples of the contract, not captured output from
the commands above:

| Evidence state | CLI `power_w` | CLI `power_coverage` | JSON fields |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qualifying energy evidence | `450 W` | `90%` | `power_w: 450`, `power_coverage: 0.9` |
| Measurable coverage below 90% | `unavailable` | `89%` | `power_w: null`, `power_coverage: 0.89` |
| Energy-aware provider with no covered operations | `unavailable` | `0%` | `power_w: null`, `power_coverage: 0` |
| Unsupported energy provider, topology, or a role without energy evidence | `unavailable` | `unavailable` | `power_w: null`, `power_coverage: null` |

Unavailable values include a short reason, such as insufficient coverage or an unsupported
provider. Zero coverage is valid only when the energy-aware path can establish it; an unsupported
path must not fabricate `0%`. JSON always returns both keys, with numbers when available and
`null` otherwise, never placeholder strings, `NaN`, or zero watts. These synthetic values do not guarantee
power coverage for another hardware/model/backend combination.

**What changed:** AIC uses its default aggregated estimator at batch size 64; AISimulate
simulates serving traffic at concurrency 64. Both model aggregated serving, but their
scheduling calculations differ, so their power estimates need not be numerically equal.
Both workflows must expose summary power independently of detail selection. This implementation does not
qualify hardware accuracy or add a power/energy optimization objective. Modeled GPU power is
not whole-node or datacenter consumption.

The unified EPD path can preserve limited encoder-power metadata in `predict --format json` and
the `summary` in `prediction.json`: `encoder_power_w` appears only when encoder energy data is
available, alongside `encoder_power_coverage`. With no data, coverage is zero and the wattage field
is omitted. The normal terminal summary does not display these power fields. Recommendation
artifacts can also retain this metadata for each candidate. These fields do not provide a power
report for the full encoder-plus-language deployment or replace AIC's power analysis for that
topology. Use the compatibility command or SDK when full-deployment EPD power is required.

#### 4.11.3 Captured result

The B200 AIC and AISimulate commands above, each with and without `--detail energy`, were
run on 2026-09-15 (Pacific) from a freshly built application wheel combining
[#144 at `01744c7e`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aisimulate/commit/01744c7efee7c0767ec2d27a72e2749528bdde34)
and [#212 at `a83ad4f1`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aisimulate/commit/a83ad4f162669b318786cc279f320650ec09d5b1).
Both bundled CLIs used Llama 3.1 8B, two B200 GPUs, TRT-LLM `1.3.0rc20`, 1,024 input tokens,
and 128 output tokens. AIC uses its default `agg` mode with batch size 64; AISimulate
runs 100 requests at concurrency 64 in `aggregated` mode. These are modeled results from
operation profiles, and can change with code or data revisions.

**Positive power in both CLIs, with and without energy detail:**

| Captured output | No `--detail` | `--detail energy` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| AIC `Power (per GPU)` | 660.4 W | 660.4 W |
| AISimulate `power_w` | 655.94 W | 655.94 W |
| AISimulate `power_coverage` | 90.70% | 90.70% |
| AISimulate completed requests | 100 | 100 |
| AISimulate output throughput (tokens/s) | 8,215.67 | 8,215.67 |

Both AISimulate `prediction.json` files contain identical power fields:

```json
{
  "power_w": 655.9411158961085,
  "power_coverage": 0.9070317503277922
}
```

**Additional AIC energy output** (selected lines; per-operation rows omitted):

```text
  Detailed Breakdown (energy)
Energy Breakdown (scheduled active work per GPU)
Mixed steps energy (total = 468748.423 W·ms, coverage = 91.6%, avg P = 680.5 W)
Decode-only steps energy (total = 131716.846 W·ms, coverage = 90.5%, avg P = 597.4 W)
```

The AIC breakdown also reports positive operation energy, including
`context_gate_ffn1_gemm = 184423.039 W·ms` in mixed steps and
`generation_gate_ffn1_gemm = 43419.182 W·ms` in decode-only steps. These totals use
the same scheduling weights as the AIC summary. Mixed steps contain both prefill and
decode work; their shared operation names retain AIC's `context_` prefix.

**Additional AISimulate energy output:**

```text
Detail: energy
AISimulate active forward-pass energy diagnostics (per GPU)
Aggregate: power=655.94 W coverage=90.70% gate=90.00% status=available
```

Captured phase rows, rounded for readability:

| Phase | Energy (W-ms/GPU) | Active latency (ms) | Covered latency (ms) | Coverage | Power (W/GPU) | Status/source |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| prefill | 503,271.17 | 724.71 | 662.76 | 91.45% | 694.44 | available mixed:mixed |
| decode | 518,684.44 | 833.29 | 750.39 | 90.05% | 622.46 | available mixed:mixed |

Selected captured operation rows:

| Phase | Operation | Energy (W-ms/GPU) | Active latency (ms) | Coverage | Status/source |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| prefill | `context_gate_ffn1_gemm` | 216,887.63 | 248.23 | 100.00% | available measured:silicon |
| prefill | `context_attention` | 41,980.72 | 49.94 | 100.00% | available mixed:mixed |
| decode | `generation_gate_ffn1_gemm` | 179,868.69 | 191.46 | 100.00% | available measured:silicon |
| decode | `generation_attention` | 81,958.47 | 214.80 | 100.00% | available measured:silicon |

Each phase has 14 operation rows. The default terminal table shows 12 and identifies the
omitted rows; `details.sections.energy.diagnostics.phases` in the saved report retains all 14.
Operations without energy evidence, such as activation and normalization, still show
unavailable energy and its reason; they account for the uncovered latency.

The two CLIs both publish positive power using their aggregated serving paths. AIC
approximates mixed/decode step counts; AISimulate schedules individual requests, so the
executed forward passes and power estimates differ. Within each CLI,
adding `--detail energy` preserves summary power and adds the breakdown.

<a id="ngram-prompt-lookup-speculative-decoding"></a>

### 4.12 Ngram prompt-lookup speculative decoding

**Before — AIC estimates decode cost using a supplied average acceptance:**

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --estimate-mode static_gen --tp-size 2 --batch-size 64 --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --spec-method ngram --spec-num-draft-tokens 3 --spec-accepted-tokens 1.5
```

AIC prices target verification at four token positions and uses the supplied mean of
1.5 accepted draft tokens to estimate 2.5 output tokens of progress per iteration.

**After — simulate serving with ngram speculation.** Reuse `prediction.yaml` from
[section 3.1](#31-migrate-one-concrete-deployment):

```bash
aisimulate predict --config prediction.yaml \
  --set 'engine.speculation={kind: ngram, num_speculative_tokens: 3, acceptance_rates: [0.75, 0.8, 0.25], seed: 42}' \
  --output-dir ./ngram-prediction
```

To search deployment configurations with the same speculative assumptions, reuse
`budget-search.yaml` from [section 3.2](#32-search-with-a-fixed-gpu-budget):

```bash
aisimulate recommend --config budget-search.yaml \
  --set engine.backend=vllm \
  --set 'engine.speculation={kind: ngram, num_speculative_tokens: 3, acceptance_rates: [0.75, 0.8, 0.25], seed: 42}' \
  --output-dir ./ngram-recommendations
```

**Result to inspect:** `ngram-prediction/prediction.json` contains serving latency and throughput.
`ngram-recommendations/recommendation.json` contains the search results, and saved prediction YAML
under `ngram-recommendations/recommendations/` preserves the speculation block. Recommendation
keeps draft count and acceptance fixed; it does not search them.

**What changed:** AIC's fixed-batch estimate uses a scalar mean. Replay samples each draft token's
acceptance conditional on all earlier draft tokens being accepted. This illustrative distribution
has the same mean: `0.75 + 0.75*0.8 + 0.75*0.8*0.25 = 1.5` accepted draft tokens. A scalar mean
does not uniquely determine that distribution. These values are workload assumptions, not
predicted acceptance. AISimulate also models request arrivals and scheduling, so matching the
acceptance mean does not make the two CLIs' latency or throughput results equivalent.

The initial scope is offline engine-stack vLLM aggregated/disaggregated language workers with
op-level timing. The model assumes a lookup draft is available every round; actual token matching,
host lookup latency, and mixed drafted/draftless rounds are not modeled. Prompt lookup is separate
from KV prefix reuse and AIC's `--prefix N` cached-input assumption. See the
[ngram configuration and supported combinations](user-guide.md#prompt-lookup-ngram-speculative-decoding).
Other speculative schemes retain their [compatibility/SDK interfaces](#estimator-controls-and-speculative-decoding).

### 4.13 Select the smallest qualifying GPU configuration

**Before — AIC estimates minimum GPUs and replica counts:**

Use `aiconfigurator cli recommend` with `--target-request-rate` or `--target-concurrency` for
AIC's minimum-GPU and replica-sizing result. For four requests/s under explicit latency limits:

```bash
aiconfigurator cli recommend \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --target-request-rate 4 --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --ttft 800 --tpot 30 --strict-sla
```

**Result to inspect:** the sizing table reports required GPUs, parallel configurations, and replica
counts under the requested load and SLA. For closed-loop sizing, replace `--target-request-rate 4`
with `--target-concurrency 32`. The [request-rate example](#33-search-under-a-request-rate) explains
why AISimulate's alternative configuration ranking can choose a different GPU count.

Legacy `default` also routes to sizing when a load target is supplied without `--total-gpus`.
If both are supplied, it uses the GPU budget and warns that the load target is ignored.

**After — AISimulate searches for the smallest qualifying configuration:**

Use `optimization.target: min_gpus` to minimize provisioned GPUs among evaluated configurations
that meet your workload and latency requirements. For a required four SLA-compliant requests/s,
reuse `budget-search.yaml` from section 3.2:

```bash
aisimulate recommend --config budget-search.yaml \
  --set 'traffic.load={type: constant_rate, requests_per_second: 5}' \
  --set traffic.stop.requests=500 \
  --set optimization.target=min_gpus \
  --set optimization.constraints.min_goodput_rps=4 \
  --output-dir ./minimum-gpu-search
```

**Result to inspect:** `recommendation.json` records provisioned `used_gpus`, measured
`goodput_request_throughput_rps` for the request-rate floor, and rejected candidates. Selected YAML
files are ordered by fewest GPUs, then higher `goodput_output_throughput_tok_s` and lower E2E
latency. The optimizer receives the same feasibility checks and GPU-count objective used for
final selection, before top-N truncation. No qualifying result
exits with status 1 and produces no selected YAML.

The example offers five requests/s and requires four completed within the per-request SLA per
second over the full replay, including startup and drain. These are separate controls; offering
exactly four requests/s may not deliver four over a short finite replay. Increase the duration and
trial budget for your workload. This result is the **smallest qualifying configuration found**,
not a proof of a global minimum or an extrapolated replica estimate.

For fixed-concurrency sizing, reuse the original `budget-search.yaml` and set only the objective:

```bash
aisimulate recommend --config budget-search.yaml \
  --set optimization.target=min_gpus \
  --output-dir ./minimum-gpu-concurrency
```

`min_gpus` always enforces the configured aggregate-mean SLA bounds. A delivered-goodput floor is
optional for fixed concurrency and required for fixed request-rate traffic. This initial path
supports standalone AISimulate static engine pools and fixed synthetic request-rate or concurrency
traffic; Dynamo integration is not supported. It rejects
adapters, traces, sessions, searched traffic loads, and candidate-relative KV load. Analytical EPD
supports fixed concurrency and aggregate latency only. See the [scoring contract](../sweeper/optimization-goals.md#minimum-gpus).

## 5. Remaining feature and performance gaps

These gaps concern the unified `aisimulate predict` and `aisimulate recommend` commands. The
AISimulate package still includes the compatibility AIC CLI and SDKs, so a feature can be available
in the package without a unified-CLI replacement.

Migration prioritizes features that materially support serving prediction and deployment decisions.
It does not aim to reproduce every AIC option. Some differences are deliberate product boundaries,
including the [static estimate modes](#521-static-estimates) and
[fixed cached-prefix counts](#fixed-cached-prefix-counts), rather than planned migration work.

<a id="recommendation-runtime"></a>

### 5.1 Recommendation runtime

**Bayesian recommendation can take much longer than AIC sizing.** Recorded September 11–12, 2026
baseline measurements on an Apple M3 Pro used Python 3.12.11, native release builds, and shared
B200/vLLM 0.24.0 performance data. Medians from three fresh-process runs were:

| Case | AIC `recommend` | AISimulate Bayesian `recommend` | AISimulate / AIC runtime |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Llama 3.1 8B; ISL 1,024 / OSL 128; concurrency 10; 32 AISimulate suggestions | 8.34 s | 48.81 s | 5.9× |
| Llama 3.1 70B; ISL 8,192 / OSL 512; concurrency 32; 64 AISimulate suggestions | 7.24 s | 148.32 s | 20.5× |

These are CLI wall-clock times, including startup, search, replay, and output writes; they are not
GPU inference latency. AIC performed minimum-GPU agg/disagg sizing under an SLA. AISimulate searched
aggregated throughput/GPU with GPU ceilings of 8 and 32 and no SLA filter. The workloads therefore
produce different answers. These dated source snapshots do not measure the current checkout or
establish a universal speed ratio; the 70B runs also used a shared workstation.
Profiling identified Bayesian suggestion generation as a major cost in addition to replay.

A proposed optimizer change reduced the recorded Bayesian medians to **42.97 s** and **145.89 s**,
leaving about **5.2×** and **20.2×** gaps. The small 70B reduction was within run-to-run variation.
Random search was much faster in the recorded optimized variant: **3.39 s** for 8B with four workers
and **7.74 s** for 70B with sixteen workers. Its best throughput/GPU score was about **35%** and
**17%** lower than Bayesian, respectively. Default-budget Bayesian searches (320 suggestions) were
not timed. The general examples above explicitly use eight random trials; their runtime and search
quality should not be confused with the Bayesian cases.

The [benchmark procedure](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aisimulate/blob/dc797c4f8ee79138cea359f881a363cb1b0b6330/docs/cli/runtime-benchmark.md),
[8B evidence](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aisimulate/blob/dc797c4f8ee79138cea359f881a363cb1b0b6330/docs/cli/benchmarks/recommend-runtime-2026-09-11.json),
and [70B evidence](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aisimulate/blob/dc797c4f8ee79138cea359f881a363cb1b0b6330/docs/cli/benchmarks/recommend-runtime-70b-2026-09-12.json)
pin the source revisions, commands, timings, and scores. Choose algorithm, trial budget, and worker
count explicitly; reducing search time can reduce recommendation quality. Use AIC sizing when its
answer fits your task and fast iteration is important.

To time your own searches, save `budget-search.yaml` from the general example and run these from
its directory. The two AISimulate commands use the same 32-trial budget and four workers; the AIC
command performs its own sizing search. The AISimulate commands enable JAX 64-bit mode for
numerical stability in the Bayesian optimizer:

```bash
time -p aiconfigurator cli recommend \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --target-concurrency 32 --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --ttft 800 --tpot 30 --strict-sla

time -p env JAX_ENABLE_X64=True aisimulate recommend --config budget-search.yaml \
  --set optimizer.algorithm=bayesian \
  --set optimizer.max_trials=32 --set optimizer.parallelism=4 \
  --output-dir ./timed-bayesian

time -p env JAX_ENABLE_X64=True aisimulate recommend --config budget-search.yaml \
  --set optimizer.algorithm=random \
  --set optimizer.max_trials=32 --set optimizer.parallelism=4 \
  --output-dir ./timed-random
```

**Result to inspect:** `time` prints elapsed wall time as `real`. Compare the two AISimulate
`recommendation.json` files for selected configurations and scores as well as runtime. Cached
results and early stopping can reduce the number of unique replays. The AIC output reports a
sizing result. This H200 example measures your local workload; it does not
reproduce the dated B200 benchmark table or establish equivalent AIC/AISimulate answers.

<a id="53-static-estimates-and-diagnostics"></a>

### 5.2 Static estimates and diagnostics

<a id="531-static-estimates"></a>

#### 5.2.1 Static estimates

**Intentionally not migrated to the AISimulate CLI.** AIC's `static` (fixed-batch prefill plus
decode), `static_ctx` (prefill only), and `static_gen` (decode only) modes are not exposed by
`aisimulate predict` or `aisimulate recommend`.

Fixed-batch estimates omit request arrivals, queueing, and serving scheduling. An isolated
prefill-only or decode-only estimate does not answer the end-to-end latency, throughput, or SLA
questions that drive AISimulate's serving workflow. These modes do not provide enough value for
that workflow to justify additional CLI modes and output contracts.

Use `predict` to [evaluate a deployment under its workload](#31-migrate-one-concrete-deployment)
and `recommend` to [compare deployments](#32-search-with-a-fixed-gpu-budget). Serving concurrency
controls in-flight requests; it is not a substitute for a fixed batch size.
[Serving with prefill/decode disaggregation](#41-predict-regular-prefilldecode-disaggregation)
remains supported.

For specialized estimator diagnostics, the existing AIC compatibility CLI and SDK remain available.
For example, estimate decode for a fixed batch:

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --estimate-mode static_gen --batch-size 64 --tp-size 2 \
  --isl 1024 --osl 128
```

**Result to inspect:** the terminal summary describes the fixed batch and modeled decode phase. See
[estimate modes and outputs](legacy-aic-user-guide.md#estimate-mode).

<a id="detailed-diagnostics"></a>
<a id="532-detailed-diagnostics"></a>
<a id="532-remaining-detailed-diagnostic-gaps"></a>
<a id="532-detailed-diagnostic-availability-limits"></a>
<a id="522-remaining-detailed-diagnostic-gaps"></a>

#### 5.2.2 Detailed-diagnostic availability limits

All five selectors (`summary,memory,time,energy,source`) are supported by `predict`; `all`
requests them together. [Section 4.10](#410-inspect-prediction-details) covers timing and
provenance; [section 4.11](#411-power-and-energy-analysis) covers energy.

The native op-level engine exports scheduled phase/operation timings, SOL comparisons, source
tags, and executed MoE communication measurement substitutions. An operation without a SOL
implementation keeps its actual timing and provenance and reports the SOL reason. These
comparisons use the same scheduled shapes and do not replace the selected estimator.

Whole-model FPM and latency-only providers do not expose per-operation timing/source evidence.
Analytical EPD/AFD overlays and the external Dynamo Python adapter do not export a qualified
combined operation report. Such paths retain explicit unavailable reasons; serving timing
statistics remain available where exported. Source tags describe the engine's provenance
classification, not full file/row lineage. Fallback records describe executed measurement
substitutions, not every estimator-construction attempt.

For specialized fixed-batch diagnostics, keep the compatibility
[static-estimate workflow](#521-static-estimates).

<a id="deployment-artifacts"></a>
<a id="54-deployment-artifacts"></a>

### 5.3 Deployment artifacts

<a id="541-standalone-generate-command-not-planned"></a>

#### 5.3.1 Standalone `generate` command: not planned

`aiconfigurator cli generate` is a fast shortcut for a basic deployment configuration without
search or SLA optimization. We do not plan to add an equivalent standalone `aisimulate generate`
command. The AIC command remains available in the bundled compatibility CLI.

For a quick basic deployment configuration with the AIC shortcut:

```bash
aiconfigurator cli generate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --total-gpus 8 \
  --deployment-target dynamo-j2 --save-dir ./deployment
```

**Result to inspect:** `deployment/` contains a basic deployment configuration generated without
search or SLA optimization.

<a id="542-deployment-files-not-yet-available-in-the-aisimulate-cli"></a>

#### 5.3.2 Deployment files: not yet available in the AISimulate CLI

`aisimulate recommend` does not yet create deployment files, such as launch scripts or Kubernetes
manifests. It saves the setups it recommends in `recommendations/*.yaml`. Pass one of these files
to `aisimulate predict` to simulate that setup again.

To create deployment files today, use the bundled AIC commands or the
[generator SDK](../../python/aisimulate/docs/generator_overview.md). AIC's normal `default` and
`exp` workflows generate deployment files for supported configurations when `--save-dir` is supplied;
a separate `generate` command is not required. Generation does not support
analytical EPD/AFD or heterogeneous P/D hardware.

<a id="experiment-files-and-support-queries"></a>
<a id="55-experiment-files-and-support-queries"></a>

### 5.4 Experiment files and support queries

Existing named experiments still run with AIC. For a complete runnable input, save
`legacy-search.yaml` from the [legacy search example](#56-legacy-search-domains-and-topology-coverage)
below, then run it and query model support:

```bash
aiconfigurator cli exp --yaml-path legacy-search.yaml --save-dir ./aic-experiments
aiconfigurator cli support --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B --system all --backend all
```

**Result to inspect:** `aic-experiments/` contains the experiment results; the second command prints
AIC's [agg/disagg support matrix](https://ai-dynamo.org/aisimulate/support-matrix/).
Translate each experiment separately before moving it to the unified CLI. Estimator data coverage
alone does not establish support for an entire CLI workflow.

<a id="estimator-controls-and-speculative-decoding"></a>
<a id="56-estimator-controls-and-speculative-decoding"></a>
<a id="55-estimator-controls-and-speculative-decoding"></a>
<a id="56-remaining-estimator-and-speculative-decoding-gaps"></a>

### 5.5 Remaining estimator and speculative-decoding gaps

For supported estimator selection, fallback, database/transfer policies, system roots, and
regression/correction tuning, see [section 4.6](#46-select-and-configure-performance-estimators).
Unified prediction and recommendation also support pinned quantization/kernel controls and
MTP with explicit accepted-token assumptions; see [section 4.6.3](#preserve-pinned-engine-and-request-controls).
Ngram prediction and recommendation are covered in [section 4.12](#412-ngram-prompt-lookup-speculative-decoding).
Fixed-batch estimates, fixed cached-token assumptions, speculative schemes beyond MTP and ngram,
and per-operation source diagnostics continue to use the compatibility CLI or SDK.

**Pin quantization and select an attention implementation.** For a dense-model decode estimate
with explicit BF16 compute/cache settings and the framework's default attention implementation:

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --estimate-mode static_gen --batch-size 64 --tp-size 2 \
  --isl 1024 --osl 128 \
  --gemm-quant-mode bfloat16 --kvcache-quant-mode bfloat16 \
  --fmha-quant-mode bfloat16 --comm-quant-mode half \
  --attention-backend default --detail time,source
```

**Result to inspect:** the printed configuration and timing/source breakdown use the requested
settings. Supported selectors depend on the backend and data. For serving simulation, pin the
same supported quantization and kernel selectors through the unified `engine` fields in
[section 4.6.3](#preserve-pinned-engine-and-request-controls). To serve an FP8 checkpoint with the
SGLang/vLLM `--kv-cache-dtype auto` (BF16) cache instead of the inferred FP8 one, set
`engine.workers.<role>.kv_cache.dtype: bfloat16`, which pins both `--kvcache-quant-mode` and
`--fmha-quant-mode` to BF16 for that role. The static estimate and source
breakdown above remain compatibility features; see [advanced AIC tuning](../../python/aisimulate/docs/advanced_tuning.md).

<a id="exact-cached-prefix-estimates"></a>

**Specify an exact cached-prefix count with AIC.** `--prefix N` is
[intentionally not migrated](#fixed-cached-prefix-counts): AISimulate prefers dynamic prefix reuse
for serving simulation. Use the compatibility CLI when you need a fixed cached-token assumption.
This example assumes 256 of the 1,024 input tokens are already cached for each request:

```bash
aiconfigurator cli estimate \
  --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B \
  --system h200_sxm --backend vllm --backend-version 0.24.0 \
  --estimate-mode static_ctx --batch-size 1 --tp-size 2 \
  --isl 1024 --osl 128 --prefix 256 \
  --detail time
```

**Result to inspect:** the summary prints `Prefix: 256`, followed by the timing breakdown for that
assumption. AISimulate supports prefix-cache simulation, but `kv_cache.prefix_caching: true` enables
reuse instead of setting a fixed cached-token count. Session shared-prefix settings describe
workload sharing. `traffic.source.cached_prefix_tokens` likewise sets an exact shared prefix for
synthetic requests, with a cold first request and reuse governed by cache state. Keep AIC when
you require its fixed cached-token assumption.

**Other speculative-decoding schemes.** Ngram prediction and recommendation are covered in
[section 4.12](#412-ngram-prompt-lookup-speculative-decoding). The unified CLI supports MTP through
`engine.nextn` and an explicit `engine.nextn_accepted`, as shown in
[section 4.6.3](#preserve-pinned-engine-and-request-controls). Neither path predicts acceptance rates.
EAGLE-3, DFlash, DSpark, and standalone draft models still use the compatibility CLI or SDK, subject to
[scheme-specific configuration and limits](../../python/aisimulate/src/aisimulate_core/sdk/speculation/README.md#estimate-command).

<a id="57-legacy-search-domains-and-topology-coverage"></a>

### 5.6 Legacy search domains and topology coverage

<a id="571-pipeline-parallelism-pp"></a>

#### 5.6.1 Pipeline parallelism (PP)

**Keep PP-dependent workflows on the AIC compatibility CLI.**
AIC supports PP estimation and search. AISimulate's default search fixes PP=1. Explicit
`engine.workers.<role>.parallelism.pipeline` inputs can reach analytical timing, KV-capacity
estimation, and GPU accounting, but do not provide validated pipeline-stage scheduling,
microbatch overlap, or pipeline-bubble simulation.

For an explicit AIC TP/PP search, save this flat experiment YAML as `legacy-search.yaml`:

```yaml
pp_sweep:
  serving_mode: agg
  model_path: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B
  system_name: h200_sxm
  backend_name: vllm
  backend_version: "0.24.0"
  total_gpus: 4
  isl: 1024
  osl: 128
  ttft: 800
  tpot: 30
  agg_num_gpu_candidates: [2, 4]
  agg_tp_candidates: [1, 2]
  agg_pp_candidates: [1, 2]
  agg_dp_candidates: [1]
  agg_moe_tp_candidates: [1]
  agg_moe_ep_candidates: [1]
  agg_cp_candidates: [1]
```

```bash
aiconfigurator cli exp --yaml-path legacy-search.yaml --save-dir ./legacy-search-results
```

**Result to inspect:** the terminal and `legacy-search-results/` contain the `pp_sweep` results,
including feasible TP/PP configurations and their latency/throughput. This example requests PP=1/2
and pins CP=1.

<a id="572-context-parallelism-cp"></a>

#### 5.6.2 Context parallelism (CP)

**The unified AISimulate CLI has no CP configuration field.** AIC exposes per-role
`agg_cp_candidates`, `prefill_cp_candidates`, and `decode_cp_candidates`. CP>1 support depends on
the model family and backend; the dense-model PP example above does not establish CP>1 support.
Keep supported CP workflows on AIC. See
[advanced AIC search controls](../../python/aisimulate/docs/advanced_tuning.md).

<a id="573-gpus-per-worker-and-parallelism-search-domains"></a>

#### 5.6.3 GPUs per worker and parallelism search domains

**AISimulate's default preset does not reproduce every AIC parallelism domain.** AIC's
`*_num_gpu_candidates` lists explicit GPU counts per worker. AISimulate's default preset uses
1/2/4/8/16 GPUs per worker; `max_candidate_gpus` caps the entire deployment, not one worker.
Explicit supported parallelism configurations are a separate path. Keep AIC when you need its
exact candidate domain; see the [default search projection](../sweeper/architecture.md#parallelism-search-projection).

<a id="574-fixed-batch-sizes-and-capacity-sweeps"></a>

#### 5.6.4 Fixed batch sizes and capacity sweeps

**AIC batch size has no direct mapping to regular AISimulate serving batches.** AIC can estimate
a fixed `--batch-size` and sweep operating points. AISimulate's aggregated and P/D schedulers
form batches from the workload: `traffic.load.concurrency` controls in-flight requests, while
`scheduler.max_sequences` limits batch admission. Neither fixes every batch to a requested size.
Fixed-batch static modes are [intentionally not migrated](#521-static-estimates). Keep AIC for
those diagnostics or its original capacity-sweep behavior.

<a id="575-context-and-request-length-sweeps"></a>

#### 5.6.5 Context and request-length sweeps

**Context length and synthetic request lengths stay fixed within one unified-CLI search.**
`engine.context_length`, `traffic.source.input_tokens`, and `traffic.source.output_tokens` do not
accept recommendation domains. Use separate AISimulate configurations to compare lengths, or
keep AIC `exp` for existing named experiments with different ISL, OSL, and context limits.

<a id="576-exhaustive-search-and-legacy-ranking"></a>

#### 5.6.6 Exhaustive search and legacy ranking

**AISimulate recommendation does not guarantee exhaustive coverage of a search domain.**
Its Bayesian and random optimizers sample within `optimizer.max_trials`; increasing the budget
does not guarantee every valid configuration is evaluated. Keep AIC when you need its enumerated
capacity sweep and ranking semantics.

<a id="577-model-backend-and-topology-combinations"></a>

#### 5.6.7 Model, backend, and topology combinations

**Support for one model/backend does not imply support for every topology.** Check the specific
feature's restrictions before migrating:

| Feature | Current AISimulate boundary |
|---|---|
| [Analytical EPD](#predict-and-search-analytical-epd) | Fixed synthetic images and concurrency; no event-level encoder queueing or embedding transfer. |
| [AFD](#afd-translation) | Analytical fixed-length synthetic traffic; no native AFD deployment generation. |
| [Heterogeneous P/D hardware](#migrate-heterogeneous-pd-hardware-with-sweeper) | Unified `predict` / `recommend` and Sweeper; P/D roles can override hardware but share one model, backend, and backend version. |
| [Native host offload](#model-cache-capacity-and-host-offload) | Aggregated vLLM with attention DP=1 and prefix caching; recommendation requires `preset: false` and fixed `attention_data: 1`, while other supported parallelism fields may be searched. |

## 6. Reference

<a id="common-input-mapping"></a>

### 6.1 Common input mapping

Use these mappings when translating a workflow; choose traffic and search objectives explicitly.

| AIC input | AISimulate input | Translation note |
|---|---|---|
| `--model-path`, `--system`, `--backend` | `engine.model`, `engine.hardware`, `engine.backend` | Concrete model, hardware, and backend; optional `engine.backend_version` pins the version. |
| `--isl`, `--osl` | `traffic.source.input_tokens`, `traffic.source.output_tokens` | Synthetic request lengths. |
| `--total-gpus` | `optimization.constraints.max_candidate_gpus` | Search ceiling; prediction GPU use follows worker parallelism and replicas. |
| `--target-request-rate` | `traffic.load: {type: constant_rate, requests_per_second: N}` | Offered traffic. |
| `--target-concurrency` | `traffic.load: {type: concurrency, concurrency: N}` | In-flight request cap. |
| `--ttft`, `--tpot` | `evaluation.sla.ttft_ms`, `evaluation.sla.itl_ms` | Goodput uses request-level latency; strict filtering uses aggregate means, including mean TPOT. |
| `--request-latency` | `evaluation.sla.e2e_ms` | Use instead of TTFT/ITL bounds. |
| `--strict-sla` | `optimization.strict_sla: true` | Reject aggregate-mean latency violations before ranking. |

See the [AISimulate input reference](user-guide.md#configuration-model) for full schemas and
[result reference](user-guide.md#outputs) for files and metric units. Analytical EPD uses
aggregate-only SLA semantics, described in its feature guide.

<a id="repository-and-release-transition"></a>

### 6.2 Repository and release transition

AISimulate is the home for ongoing development, issues, and releases. The standalone
AIConfigurator repository is scheduled to archive after its final 0.12.0 release. AISimulate 0.13.0
keeps the AIC compatibility command; removal is targeted for 0.14.0 after all remaining workflows
have verified unified-CLI replacements. See the [release transition policy](../../README.md#aiconfigurator-repository-transition)
and [repository history](../repository-history.md).
